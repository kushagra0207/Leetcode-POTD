Hint
A binary tree is named Even-Odd if it meets the following conditions:

The root of the binary tree is at level index 0, its children are at level index 1, their children are at level index 2, etc.
For every even-indexed level, all nodes at the level have odd integer values in strictly increasing order (from left to right).
For every odd-indexed level, all nodes at the level have even integer values in strictly decreasing order (from left to right).
Given the root of a binary tree, return true if the binary tree is Even-Odd, otherwise return false.

 

Example 1:


  public class Solution {
    private List<Integer> prev = new ArrayList<>();

    public boolean isEvenOddTree(TreeNode root) {
        TreeNode current = root;
        return dfs(current, 0);
    }

    private boolean dfs(TreeNode current, int level) {
        // Base case, an empty tree is Even-Odd
        if (current == null) {
            return true;
        }

        // Compare the parity of current and level
        if (current.val % 2 == level % 2) {
            return false;
        }

        // Add a new level to prev if we've reached a new level
        while (prev.size() <= level) {
            prev.add(0);
        }

        // If there are previous nodes on this level, check increasing/decreasing
        // If on an even level, check that current's value is greater than the previous on this level
        // If on an odd level, check that current's value is less than the previous on this level
        if (prev.get(level) != 0 && 
                ((level % 2 == 0 && current.val <= prev.get(level)) || 
                 (level % 2 == 1 && current.val >= prev.get(level)))) {
            return false;
        }

        // Add current value to prev at index level
        prev.set(level, current.val);

        // Recursively call DFS on the left and right children
        return dfs(current.left, level + 1) && dfs(current.right, level + 1);
    }
}
