  791. Custom Sort String
Solved

You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.


class Solution {
    public String customSortString(String order, String s) {
        // Create a frequency table
        Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();

        // Initialize frequencies of letters
        // freq[c] = frequency of char c in s
        int N = s.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            char letter = s.charAt(i);
            freq.put(letter, freq.getOrDefault(letter, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Iterate order string to append to result
        int K = order.length();
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
            char letter = order.charAt(i);
            while (freq.getOrDefault(letter, 0) > 0) {
                result.append(letter);
                freq.put(letter, freq.get(letter) - 1);
            }
        }

        // Iterate through freq and append remaining letters
        // This is necessary because some letters may not appear in `order`
        for (char letter : freq.keySet()) {
            int count = freq.get(letter);
            while (count > 0) {
                result.append(letter);
                count--;
            }
        }

        // Return the result
        return result.toString();
    }
}
