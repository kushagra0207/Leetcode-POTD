Hint
Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 until there are no such sequences.

After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.

 

(Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of ListNode objects.)

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
Output: [3,1]
Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
Output: [1]



class Solution {
    public ListNode removeZeroSumSublists(ListNode head) {
        ListNode front = new ListNode(0, head);
        ListNode current = front;
        int prefixSum = 0;
        Map<Integer, ListNode> prefixSumToNode = new HashMap<>();
        prefixSumToNode.put(0, front);

        // Calculate the prefix sum for each node and add to the hashmap
        // Duplicate prefix sum values will be replaced
        while (current != null) {
            prefixSum += current.val;
            prefixSumToNode.put(prefixSum, current);
            current = current.next;
        }

        // Reset prefix sum and current
        prefixSum = 0;
        current = front;

        // Delete zero sum consecutive sequences 
        // by setting node before sequence to node after
        while (current != null) {
            prefixSum += current.val;
            current.next = prefixSumToNode.get(prefixSum).next;
            current = current.next;
        }
        return front.next; 
    }
}
